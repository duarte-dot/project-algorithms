# Algorithms Project

In this repository, you will find solutions to various programming challenges. Each challenge addresses a specific problem and demonstrates a solution in Python. The challenges aim to exercise skills such as programming logic, problem interpretation, and algorithm optimization.

## Challenges Solved

Here are the challenges developed:

### 1 - Number of Students Studying at the Same Time (Search Algorithm)
In this challenge, the goal is to find the time slot with the highest number of students accessing a study platform. Students' entry and exit times are recorded in a list of tuples, and the solution uses a brute-force approach.

### 2 - Inversion Cryptography (Testing)
This challenge involves creating tests for a cryptography function called `encrypt_message`.

### 3 - Palindromes (Recursion)
In this challenge, a function was developed to determine if a word is a palindrome (a word that reads the same forwards and backwards) using recursion.

### 4 - Anagrams (Sorting Algorithm)
An algorithm was implemented to compare two strings and determine if they are anagrams of each other. The algorithm considers uppercase and lowercase letters as equal during comparison.

### 5 - Finding Duplicate Numbers (Search Algorithm)
In this challenge, the goal is to find a duplicate number in an array of integers. The solution involves sorting the array and identifying the duplicate number.

### 6 - Palindromes (Iterative Approach)
This challenge is a variation of Challenge 3, where it was determined if a word is a palindrome, but this time using an iterative solution.

Each challenge has its own folder with source code and, where applicable, unit tests.
